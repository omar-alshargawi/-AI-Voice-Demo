# 🧠 AI Voice Assistant (Transcribe + Respond + Speak)

This project is an interactive voice assistant powered by [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) and [Cohere](https://cohere.com/). It takes audio input from the user, transcribes it to text, generates a smart and thoughtful AI response using Cohere's large language model (LLM), and converts the response back to speech using `gTTS`.
